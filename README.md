The Music Skill Project is an Alexa skill designed to play audio files hosted on Amazon S3, providing users with playback control through voice commands. This skill is ideal for streaming content such as news flashes, podcasts, or music.

Features:

- User-Friendly: The skill is designed for ease of use and understanding.

- Customizable: Users can tailor the skill to their specific needs.

- Simple Design: Optimized for single-stream content, making it perfect for news flashes, podcasts, or radio music.

- Visual Enhancements: On Alexa-enabled devices with screens, the skill can display images and text to complement the audio experience.

Known Issues:

- Playback Progress: On devices without screens, the skill currently cannot save track progress when paused.

Implementation Overview:

The skill utilizes the AudioPlayer interface to stream long-form audio content. Audio files are stored in an S3 bucket, and the skill generates pre-signed URLs to access these files securely. This method ensures that the audio content remains private while allowing Alexa to stream the files.
